# Material Selection  

## Aluminum–Lithium Alloys (Al–Li)  

- Proven usage in cryogenic tanks (e.g., alloy 2195) with good fracture toughness at 77 K.  
- Typical density ~2.65 g/cm³ vs ~2.70 for conventional alloys; specific stiffness improvement of ~10–15%.  
- Manufacturing processes: friction-stir welding (FSW), orthogrid/isogrid stiffening.  
- Strengths: high TRL, reliable hermeticity, well documented in aerospace applications.  
- Weaknesses: higher mass than composites, limited margin for future mass reduction.

## Composite Materials (CFRP + liner)  

- Multiple studies report 20–40% mass savings versus metallic tanks in some configurations.  
- Require an internal liner (aluminum/titanium/polymer) to control permeation, especially for LH₂.  
- Lower TRL for large cryogenic tanks; NDI and repair are more complex, with more hidden damage modes.

## Trade-Off Summary  

| Criterion                         | Al–Li (2195/2050) | CFRP + metallic liner        |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Mass                             | 1.0 (baseline)     | ~0.70–0.85×                  |
| Technological maturity           | High               | Medium / Low (for LH₂)       |
| Hermeticity / permeation risk    | Reliable           | Risk (H₂ permeation)         |
| Production complexity / cost     | Moderate           | Higher due to qualification  |
| Repair / inspections             | Easier             | Harder; more hidden defects  |

Based on this comparison, the recommended baseline for the upper-stage tank is an Al–Li tank with orthogrid stiffening, high-efficiency insulation, and an integrated boil-off management system.
