# Introduction  

This document describes the conceptual structural design of a cryogenic propellant tank for an orbital upper stage.  
The design covers geometry, materials, thermal insulation, boil-off management, structural supports and safety systems.  

It draws upon recent research in advanced metallic alloys (e.g., Al–Li 2195) and composite cryogenic tanks.  
Key references include:
- Sleight et al. (2013) on metallic cryotank sizing;  
- Liu et al. (2021) on composite cryotanks and weight savings.  

The objective is to present a PDR-ready baseline configuration with quantified design targets, a mass/technology trade-off, and a recommended path forward.
