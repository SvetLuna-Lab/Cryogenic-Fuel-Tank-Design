# Safety, Qualification & Test Plan  

## Structural & Fracture Control  

- Critical joints: domes, flanges, common bulkhead, feed-throughs, and support interfaces.  
- Fracture mechanics analysis: K_Ic, fatigue crack growth, and cyclic cooling (room → cryogenic) to qualify durability.  
- Slosh control: baffle system designed so that the first slosh eigenfrequency is at least 20% away from the first bending mode of the stage.

## NDI & Leak Control  

- Non-destructive inspection: ultrasonic testing (UT), radiography/CT, thermography (especially for CFRP liners and FSW joints).  
- Leak testing: helium mass spectrometry with a qualification threshold of ≤ 10⁻⁶ std·cc/s.

## Test Campaign  

1. Proof and cryoproof test at \( P_{\text{test}} = 1.25–1.5 \times P_{\text{wrk}} \) while at cryogenic temperature.  
2. Thermal cycling: repeated cooling/heating over the design lifetime.  
3. Vibration + cryogenic combined environment to simulate launch plus cryogenic hold conditions.  
4. Slosh verification: liquid fill test with measured slosh modes compared against predictions.  
5. Boil-off test: ground storage over time, measuring actual %/day versus the target.

## Documentation & Certification  

- All material and manufacturing records traceable per aerospace standards.  
- Safety case and failure modes (FMEA) documented and maintained.  
- Vent / relief subsystem designed to satisfy 2oo3 redundancy and ESD (electrostatic discharge) control  
  (grounding resistance ≤ 10⁶ Ω).
