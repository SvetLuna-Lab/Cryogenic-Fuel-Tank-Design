# Thermal Insulation & Boil-Off Management  

## Targets & Requirements  

- LH₂ tank: total heat leak ≤ **2–5 W/m²** (vacuum + MLI + VCS).  
- LOX tank: total heat leak ≤ **5–10 W/m²**.  
- Boil-off rate (on-ground stand): ≤ **0.05–0.2 %/day**.  
- Working pressure (P-wrk): LH₂ ~2.5–3.5 bar; LOX ~2–3 bar.  
- Proof pressure: ≥ 1.25–1.5 × P-wrk; Burst pressure > 2.0 × P-wrk.  

## Insulation Stack-Up  

- **Outer vacuum jacket** surrounding the primary tank shell to suppress convection and reduce conduction.  
- **Multilayer Insulation (MLI):** 30–40 alternating foil / spacer layers to reduce radiative heat flux.  
- **Vapor-Cooled Shields (VCS):** intermediate shields cooled by boil-off gas to intercept part of the heat leak.  
- **Spray-On Foam Insulation (SOFI):** applied where the vacuum jacket is infeasible (mounts, feed-lines, external surfaces).  
- **Minimise thermal bridges:** use GFRP/PEEK strut supports, titanium inserts, and dielectric breaks in fasteners and supports.

## Boil-Off & Pressurization Strategy  

- **Autogenous pressurisation:** capture or re-inject boil-off gas to maintain ullage pressure and reduce net propellant loss.  
- **Vent / relief network:** redundant (2-out-of-3) valve logic to ensure reliability under off-nominal scenarios.  
- **Sensors:** pressure, temperature, ullage level (capacitive + cryogenic radar), and leak detection (He mass spectrometer with a threshold ≤ 10⁻⁶ std·cc/s).  
- **Monitoring and early warning:** structural strain sensors (fibre-optic, fibre Bragg gratings) in high-stress zones to detect damage initiation.
